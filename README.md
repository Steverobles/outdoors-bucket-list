Icebox Items: I would love to get my styling better next time. Also adding more functionality and small things like maybe when completing a trail you can 
click a checkbox so it could show you checked it off rather than having to delete it. Also adding an API to guess what location you are inputting in the 
locations box, and lastly probably something like a tab where you can see recomemnded hikes in your area.
